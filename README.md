# Codigo.io-unit-testing
To implement 100% unit test coverage for `processor.rs`, `instructions.rs`, `errors.rs`, and `state.rs` in the Solana Native examples, I plan the following steps:

### 1. **Test Structure and Location**
   - Tests will be implemented in separate test files for modularity:
     - `tests/processor_tests.rs`
     - `tests/instructions_tests.rs`
     - `tests/errors_tests.rs`
     - `tests/state_tests.rs`
   - This will maintain a clean separation between logic and tests, making the codebase easier to manage.
   - The tests will cover all instructions and critical data structures such as `Account` and `AccountPDA`.

### 2. **Dependencies**
   - **Solana SDK and Anchor**: These will be used to mock Solana-specific data types (e.g., `Pubkey`, `ProgramResult`) and test program behavior.
   - **Mocking Library**: If necessary, libraries like `mockall` or custom mock implementations will be used to handle mocked accounts, CPIs, and system instructions.
   - **Anchor Lang**: Since the examples use Solana Native/Vanilla, Anchor can still be useful for specific deserialization functions and macros.

### 3. **Testing Instructions**
   - Ensure dependencies are installed:
     ```bash
     cargo install solana-cli
     cargo build-bpf
     ```
   - Run the tests with:
     ```bash
     cargo test --manifest-path=Cargo.toml
     ```

### 4. **Test Implementation Details**

#### `processor.rs`
   - **Focus**: This file contains the core logic that processes instructions.
   - **Tests**: Will include instruction dispatch tests, covering all possible branches (e.g., handling specific instruction IDs, verifying logic for each processing step).
   - **Mocking**: Solana `AccountInfo` will be mocked to simulate accounts passed to the processor.

#### `instructions.rs`
   - **Focus**: Instruction parsing and validation.
   - **Tests**: Unit tests will cover each instruction struct, ensuring they serialize and deserialize correctly and validate input parameters.

#### `errors.rs`
   - **Focus**: Error types used by the program.
   - **Tests**: Will ensure that custom errors return the correct codes and are properly mapped when triggered in `processor.rs`.

#### `state.rs`
   - **Focus**: Data structures like `Account` and `AccountPDA`.
   - **Tests**: Will cover initialization, serialization, and deserialization of the `Account` and `AccountPDA` structures, ensuring correct handling of state and validation rules.

### 5. **Challenges and Limitations**

#### **Mocking Limitations**
   - **Accounts**: Simulating all behavior of `AccountInfo` can be complex. Certain system-related actions (like rent calculations and program-derived addresses) might need custom mock implementations.
   - **Cross-Program Invocations (CPIs)**: Mocking CPIs will require careful handling, as they invoke external programs and require simulating correct responses.

#### **Boilerplate Code Challenges**
   - **Generated Instruction Parsers**: If the instruction parsers generated by Código’s boilerplate code are too opaque, it might be challenging to fully mock or test them. Additional manual code might be needed.

#### **CIDL Documentation Gaps**
   - **Missing Data**: If some instructions or structures are inadequately documented in the CIDL (Código Instruction Definition Language), this could block test implementation until clarified by the repository maintainers.

### 6. **Unit Tests That Couldn't Be Implemented**
   - Any unit tests that can't be implemented due to the reasons mentioned above will be documented in the code as `TODO` comments and in the accompanying documentation.

### Example Documentation for Test Execution

```markdown
# Solana Native Unit Tests

## Test Cases

### Processor Tests
- Located in `tests/processor_tests.rs`.
- Covers all instruction handlers and verifies correct execution.

### Instruction Tests
- Located in `tests/instructions_tests.rs`.
- Verifies instruction parsing, validation, and proper handling of parameters.

### Error Tests
- Located in `tests/errors_tests.rs`.
- Ensures all custom errors map to the correct error codes and propagate correctly.

### State Tests
- Located in `tests/state_tests.rs`.
- Tests serialization, deserialization, and validation for `Account` and `AccountPDA`.

## Running Tests
Ensure that the Solana CLI and build dependencies are installed:
```bash
cargo test --manifest-path=Cargo.toml
```

## Known Limitations
- **Mocking Issues**: Certain cross-program invocations and system-level actions require extensive mocking, which could not be fully implemented.
- **Boilerplate Code Challenges**: The generated instruction parsers may need additional manual testing due to the opaque nature of their implementation.
- **CIDL Gaps**: Some structures or instructions may lack proper documentation in the CIDL, which limits test coverage.
